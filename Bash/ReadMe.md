# Linux Bash Profile
<p style="text-align: center;"> ** This Profile is Under Active Development! Use at Your Own Risk! ** </p>
**Abstract:** This is just my bash profile that I have been using at my latest job.  I am still working on this actively. and plan to update it at least one time a week during the summer to improve my skill set. If you have a request please do so by generating a pull request and adding it yourself, or ask.

## Installation
Uh, this should be pretty self-explanatory.  Replace your bashrc with mine? 
This is a work in progress and any additional items you see fit to add, please do so.
