# Linux Bash Profile
<p style="text-align: center;"> ** This Profile is Under Active Development! Use at Your Own Risk! ** </p>
**Abstract:** This is just my zsh terminal setup. I do not make this for others, so do not be mad at me; I just wanted to keep this in a place where I could access it freely. If something for you works, great. If not, do not ask me to fix it because it isn't broken for me.

## Installation
Uh, this should be pretty self-explanatory.  Replace your .zshrc with mine? Copy/Pasta? Figure it out.
