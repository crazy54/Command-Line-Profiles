# JHall's Engineering Shell


## About
Contained within this profile is a magical world of... nothing. I do not use pshell anymore but I keep updated with it just in case. LINUX FTW. Go look at that .zsh config. It is way better than this. Although I have written some good functions if you need them. 

## Installation

To install this for your user, make a directory called **WindowsPowerShell** in your *Documents* folder.  This is now your root profile directory. Please make sure you place the lib folder inside as well or you will have errors when you launch PowerShell.

## Features

The meat and potatoes are contained in the list below - enjoy!

1. Cowsay is ported over and works like a charm.  Also to note, CowThink is also installed, so there is that too...  
2. Posh-Git: This has a check and autoinstaller wrapped up in the profile for you.  Don't have Posh-git?  You do  now!

3.  Tons of functions just for Engineers. Take a look and make sure to be familiar with them all before using them.  

  ** I will be typing up a ReadMe for all functions in the coming month and then posting it here **

<p style="text-align: center;"> ### Please let me know if you have any questions or issues so I can get them checked in ASAP.
