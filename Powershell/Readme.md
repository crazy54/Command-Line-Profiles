# JHall's Engineering Shell


## About
Contained within this profile is a magical world of... nothing. I do not use pshell anymore but I keep updated with it just in case. LINUX FTW. Go look at that .zsh config. It is way better than this. Although I have written some good functions if you need them. 

## Installation

To install this for your user, make a directory called **WindowsPowerShell** in your *Documents* folder.  This is now your root profile directory. Please make sure you place the lib folder inside as well or you will have errors when you launch PowerShell.

## Features


 - You can use POWERLEVEL9K or StarShip. I have configs for each within. The choice is up to you.
 - Tons of other useful functions I have made over the years.
 - Learn Bash/Shell scripting instead. Much better than this stuff.
 - oh - install choco/scoop/winget so you can use the derp function which is a single command to update your software and bins in one shot. I have that run when I end my day and I walk away from my terminal.
